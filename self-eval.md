# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  * This was a long week but I think I have gotten into a groove of working in a coding mindset. The challenges were difficult but it also felt really good when I worked through them.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  * I am comfortable in my workflow. I could probably take more breaks or just stretch my legs more often but I am giving myself enough breaks for now.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  * I am ready for mod 1. The support I think I will need once mod 1 starts will be from my classmates and working through things together.
